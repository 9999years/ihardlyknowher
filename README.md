# I Hardly Know Her

This is the code powering [I Hardly Know Her](https://ihardlyknowher.becca.ooo/), a minimalist Flickr viewer and joke (“Flickr? [I hardly know
her!](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3fztnt/what_is_x_i_hardly_knew_her_referencing/)”).

It has been updated to play nicely with PHP 7. The CSS has been marginally
improved, as have some other things. There have been no sweeping changes.

IHKH used to be hosted at [ihardlyknowher.com](http://ihardlyknowher.com/), but
now resides at [ihardlyknowher.becca.ooo](https://ihardlyknowher.becca.ooo/).

Set your particulars in `config.php` ([Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/) keys and MySQL information) and import `schema.sql` to get started.

Have fun!
